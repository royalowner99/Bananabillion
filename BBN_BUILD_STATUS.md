## ⚠️ Important

This is a **10-week full-time project**. The foundation is done, but implementing all features (boosters, shop, withdrawals, admin panel, etc.) requires significant development time.

## 💡 Recommendation

**Option 1: MVP First** (2-3 days)
- Basic BBN system
- Level & XP
- 1-2 paid boosters
- Simple withdrawal
- Test with small user base

**Option 2: Full Build** (10 weeks)
- All features from your spec
- Complete shop system
- Advanced admin panel
- Full monetization

**Option 3: Phased Rollout** (Recommended)
- Week 1-2: Core BBN + Levels
- Week 3-4: Paid boosters + Razorpay
- Week 5-6: Shop (Wheel, Mystery Box)
- Week 7-8: Withdrawal system
- Week 9-10: Polish + Launch

1. **Get Razorpay Account**:
   - Sign up at razorpay.com
   - Complete KYC
   - Get API keys
   - Add to environment variables

2. **Decide on Approach**:

## 📞 Next Actions

Let me know:
1. Do you want me to continue building controllers?
2. Should I focus on MVP features first?

I can continue building, but be aware this is a massive project that will take many hours to complete properly.
